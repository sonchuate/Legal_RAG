-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>
